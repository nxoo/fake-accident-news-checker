# fake #accident tweet checker

Checks whether a tweet is abusing the hashtag - #accident
##### example 
1. Road accident near junction mall #accident --  **true**
2. Omg, #accident, I dropped my coffee -- **false**

**Note!!**
>It's not a fake news checker
>It only checks whether a tweets context involves an actual accident be it fake or not

**Background story**
>A friend of mine who does Data Science is the one who trained the model.
He needed a user interface. I quickly built a simple website with flask that got the job done.
I plan on re-writing the whole app with Django, DRF, and twitter streaming api
